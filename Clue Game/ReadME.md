A Psychologist has been MURDERED...

1. Suspects: Werner, mark, Neil, and Barry
2. Mark plays violin
3. Neil, Mark, and Barry daydream
4. Barry cannot play music, but reads and solves problems
5. Werner never daydreams
6. Mark doesn't problem solve
7. Werner plays trumpet and problem solves
8. Neil cannot play music and cannot read
9. The murderer daydreams, is either a musician or literate, and solves problems

    Who is the murderer?
Represent these facts in Protege. Create a 'murderer' class that is equivalent to line 9. If done correctly, the Protege reasoner will return exactly one member of this class.
